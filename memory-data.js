// Instructions for customizing:
// 1. Replace the image filenames with your actual image files
// 2. Update the descriptions to match your photos
// 3. Write personal love messages for each photo
// 4. Make sure you have both "part1" and "part2" versions of each image
// 5. The "full" image should be the complete, unedited photo
// 6. Create a back.png image for the card backs (will be resized to fit)
// 7. Images don't need to be the same size - they'll be cropped to fit the card shape
// 8. You need 10 pairs total (20 cards): mm1_part1.jpg, mm1_part2.jpg, mm1_full.jpg, etc.
